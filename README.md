# 100daysofcode-Python
This is a standalone repo of TalkPython.fm's 100 day of code course. It has been moved off the forked copy due to issues seperating individual contribution from boilerplate.

This is updated sporadically and I mainly use it to sync changes between cloud servers and virtual machine environments, as well as access it from random new work devices.
